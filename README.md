Project Overview
The Password Strength Analyzer is a security tool designed to educate and protect users by evaluating the robustness of their passwords. Unlike simple length-checkers, this tool uses a sophisticated algorithm to analyze entropy, pattern recognition, and dictionary-based vulnerabilities.

The goal is to discourage the use of weak, easily guessable passwords (like Password123) and promote the adoption of complex, high-entropy credentials that can withstand Brute-Force and Dictionary attacks.

Key Features
Multi-Criteria Analysis: Evaluates passwords based on length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and uniqueness.

Entropy Calculation: Uses mathematical logic to calculate the "bits of entropy," providing a scientific measure of how hard a password is to crack.

Common Password Blacklist: Compares input against a database of millions of leaked/common passwords (e.g., RockYou list style).

Real-time Feedback: Provides instant visual feedback via a strength meter (Weak, Fair, Good, Strong).

Improvement Suggestions: Offers dynamic tips to the user (e.g., "Add a special character" or "Avoid sequential numbers").

Brute-Force Time Estimation: Estimates how long it would take a standard computer to crack the password.
